=====================================
Copyright (c) 2013-2013, Dr. Gaetan Kenway

pyOptSparse is an extension to pyOpt that allows the specifiction of
sparse optimization problems for optimizers that support it. Problem
definitions specified with pyOptSparse can be "downcast" to dense
problems for optimizers that only use dense constraint jacobians. 

Currently, the optimizers that support pyOptSparse are:

* pySNOPTSparse
